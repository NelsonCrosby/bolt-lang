Bolt Language Experiments
=========================

Bolt is an experimental programming language that I'm creating. The
design is currently documented in [a gist][bolt-design].

By *experimental*, I don't necessarily mean *way out there*, just that
I'm currently playing around without a huge amount of direction at the
moment.
